# Code names

This project was created as a contribution for the people in lockdown due to the CoViD-19 pandemic
outburst, helping board game fans to (virtually) group up and play games.

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to play online

Supposing you already know the basic game rules, all you have to do is start a group chat/call.

When starting a new game, a URL is being generated, containing information about the word cards that are being played. So the player that starts a new game may share this URL so that everyone is synced and watching the same board. 

Similarly, a "codemaster key" needs to be created, copied, shared and inserted in order to sync up, but this procedure is just for the 2 codemasters (1 for each team).

All of the communication of the game has to be done through group & private chats in 3rd party applications. There's tons of them, just pick one.
